I am focusing on Problem 48 "Self Powers" from [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/problem=48):

The problem:
> The series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + … + 10^10 = 10405071317. Find the last ten digits of the series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + … + 1000^1000.

[Jupyter Notebook HTML](https://jordynschnupp.github.io/E-Portfolio/euler.html) for both outputs of the codes below!

Here is the raw code not in a Jupyter Notebook:

```python
# Project Euler Problem #48 - Self Powers

L = 1000    
d = 10**10
# s = sum(pow(n, n, d) for n in range(1, L+1)) 
s = sum(pow(n, n) for n in range(1, L+1)) 

print("Solution = %d" % (s % d))
#=> Prints "Solution = 9110846700"
```

This was an interesting problem for me to solve because of how large the solution can be if you do not take the sum of the 10 least significant digits. I found that I did not need to use the modpow implementation in my program by using Python's pow function. Though for some fun, I went ahead and also used the modpow function to solve this problem as well. 


```python
# Project Euler Problem #48 - Self Powers

def modpow(z, a, m):
    n = 1
    while a > 0:
        if a & 1:
            n = (n * z) % m
        z = (z * z) % m
        a = a >> 1
    return n

def self_powers(limit):
    result = 0
    modulo = 10**10 

    for i in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = (result + modpow(i, i, modulo)) % modulo

    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    limit = 1000  
    result = self_powers(limit)
    print(f"The last 10 digits of the series sum are: {result}")

    # Prints "The last 10 digits of the series sum are: 9110846700"
```
